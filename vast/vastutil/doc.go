/*
Package vastutil provides utility functions for VAST processing, e.g vastutil.Unwrap.

NOTE: Please be very unenthusiastic and strict on adding member functions to this package. The use
of utility function is highly discouraged. Package httputil can provide another point of reference
for file organization.
